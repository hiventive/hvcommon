### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at `contact@hiventive.com`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the forked repository to your machine

If you just want to learn more about the project, you can start by sending us your questions and sharing us with us your impression and feedback by emailing `contact@hiventive.com`.

## Testing changes

Hiventive includes unit and functional tests as part of the repository.

Most of the tests will be launched by the continuous integration instance, so there is no strict need to run full test suites before proposing a pull request.

## Proposing changes

The Hiventive project source code repositories are hosted GitHub. All proposed changes are submitted and code reviewed using the [GitLab flow](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/) and the pull request process.

Each change to the code should start with an issue where the goal is described. The issue title should describe the desired change to inform everyone the desired change you expect. If there is no issue yet it should be created first. 

As soon you are ready to code: 

1. Start a branch from the issue from the master branch. The name of your branch should start with the issue number. 
2. Add from your working copy to the staging area
3. Commit changes to your local repository 
4. Push them to your branch
5. To share your code with the community or just discuss about it, create a pull request but keep it unassigned to let anyone know your work is in progress  
6. Wait for CI results/reviews, report the feedback in your pull request
7. Once you feel ready to submit your code, just assign to the Hiventive reviewers. We will review and provide you a feedback.

Repository mainteners will integrate it. No additional action is required from pull request authors at this point.
